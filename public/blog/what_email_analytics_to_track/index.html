            <p>Tracking email analytics is important for any and all modern organizations. Without understanding important metrics like email reply time, number of emails sent versus received, and more, organizations cannot improve upon them. It's that simple.</p>
            <p class="h_quote">First we may be asking ourselves, what is the point of tracking email analytics?
                For most the answer is obvious but even then a lot of the benefits may not be immediately clear.</p>
            <p>Whether you oversee a sales team, customer service team, recruitment team, human resources team, or just want to track your own personal email analytics, there are a number of methods for tracking and metrics to measure.</p>

        <article style="padding: 12px 12px;">
                    <p>The First Response Time, also known as the Initial Response Time, is the timespan it first takes for you or your agent(s) to respond to an email. </p>
                    <p>The ability to measure your organization’s First Response Time will provide insight on how well your customer base is being attended to. You may think that you or your team replies quickly but isolating this metric allows you to see exactly how long it takes for your customers to hear back from you.</p>
                    <p>Whether you oversee a sales team, customer service team, recruitment team, human resources team, or just want to track your own personal email analytics, there are a number of methods for tracking and metrics to measure.</p>
                    <p class="h_quote">People are reaching out their hand when they email you, and it’s reassuring to them if you reach our hand back out as soon as possible.</p>
                    <p>Establishing a good time range for your First Response Time should be a high priority. Ideally this time will allow you/your agents enough time to respond as not to cause stress before reaching the time where your customer feels neglected.</p>
                    <p>Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are often included in many contracts between companies. When you have a firm grasp of your First Response Time you can be confident whether or not you are meeting these SLA requirements.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the ability to offer Response Time Service Level Agreements doesn't have to be that hard. EmailReplyTime allows users to not only measure, but to also easily report on their First Response Time. Learn more here.</p>

        <article style="padding: 12px 12px;">
                    <p>Okay, maybe you learned that your initial replies are quick, but are you doing your best in nurturing those lines of conversation?</p>
                    <p class="h_quote">Taking into account the Average Response Time is the next step in measuring what your customer’s support journey looks like.</p>
                    <p>Consider this, you think your organization may have a high Average Response Time but you’re not sure. Your customers are starting new threads and reaching out to you or your agents again, further mudding your performance visibility. What can you do?</p>
                    <p>Making adjustments like sending out quick initial replies like “Your inquiry has been received and we will reach out soon” or “We will reach out to our team and respond in 24 hours” keep your customer base satisfied and feeling secure that their query is being attended to. Instilling this discipline in your/your teams responses will not only help your average response time, it will help optimize your working time.</p>
                    <p>Studies show that people prefer quick, reassuring status update emails. Mulling over a long, complicated, and calculated response is not the ideal method. Quick updates allow you to manage your Average Response Time and allow you the space and breathing room to write out the complicated, long-form response that may ultimately be needed.</p>
                    <p>A promise of a predefined Average Response Time can even lure in more business especially when you can report on it easily. EmailReplyTime allows for easy reporting of Average Email Response Times with our tools. Learn more here.</p>
