Customer may discontinue its use of the Product and terminate this Agreement at any time in its sole discretion by providing the Company with at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice of its intent to so terminate. In the event of Customer’s termination for convenience, Customer will not be entitled to a refund of any fees paid and Customer agrees to pay the Company any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term set forth in the applicable Order Form within thirty (30) days after the effective date of such termination.</p>
            <p>(c) Termination for Breach. Either party may terminate this Agreement (i) thirty (30) days after providing written notice to the other party of a material breach of its obligations under this Agreement if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such 30-day period, or (ii) immediately upon written notice if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors. Any such termination shall relieve the parties of all rights, obligations and liabilities to the other except, in the case of termination by the Company for Customer’s breach, for the payment of fees due by Customer for the remainder of the term set forth in the applicable Order Form, and except as provided for in Sections 8, 9, 10 and 12 through 17, which Sections shall survive the termination of this Agreement. In no event will termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay any fees payable to the Company for the period prior to the effective date of termination.</p>
            <h2>13. Confidentiality and Security</h2>
            <p>“Confidential Information” means any information or data that is disclosed by one party to the other party pursuant to this Agreement that is marked as confidential or that such party does not generally make available to the public. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can show: (a) is or becomes publicly known or available without breach of this Agreement; (b) is received by a receiving party from a third party without breach of any obligation of confidentiality; or (c) was previously known by the receiving party as shown by its written records. A receiving party agrees: (a) to hold the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in confidence, and to protect the disclosing party’s Confidential Information in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own similar confidential information (but in no event using less than reasonable care); and (b) except as expressly authorized by this Agreement, not to, directly or indirectly, use, disclose, copy, transfer or allow access to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Customer shall disclose and allow access to the Product only for the purpose of supporting and augmenting Customer’s use of the Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a receiving party may disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party as required by law, applicable regulatory authorities, or court order; in such event, such party shall use its best efforts to inform the other party prior to any such required disclosure.</p>
            <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>Customer, at its expense, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Company and its officers, directors, owners, employees, and affiliates harmless from and against any and all liability, damages, injuries, losses, costs and expenses (including attorney’s fees) arising out of or relating to Customer’s use of the Product, including but not limited to liability, damages, injuries, losses, costs and expenses arising from any claims relating to Customer’s breach of any representations, warranties, or covenants in this Agreement.</p>
            <h2>15. Liability</h2>
            <p>‍IF CUSTOMER HAS PAID FEES FOR THE PRODUCT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 5 ABOVE, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY’S LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR USE OF THE PRODUCT, WHETHER CAUSED BY FAILURE TO DELIVER, NONPERFORMANCE, DEFECTS, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE FEES PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, LICENSES OR SERVICES OR SIMILAR ECONOMIC LOSS, OR FOR ANY PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SIMILAR DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, UNDER ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER RIGHT PROVIDED HEREUNDER OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCT, OR FOR ANY CLAIM MADE BY A THIRD PARTY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LIABLE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CLAIM OR DAMAGES.</p>
            <p>In the event Customer has obtained the Product without fees or expense, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that THE COMPANY shall have no liability whatsoever (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability in tort, or by statute or under any other theory of law) to Customer or to any third party concerning performance or non-performance by THE COMPANY, or in any manner related to this Agreement or the Product. Customer further acknowledges and agrees that the exclusion of liability provided for in this paragraph is a reasonable limitation, and granted in consideration, of the fact Customer has obtained the Product without fees or expense. The exclusion of liability in this Section represents the agreed and bargained for understanding of the parties and the absence of compensation to THE COMPANY for the Product reflects such understanding. In the event the foregoing exclusion of liability is unenforceable under any applicable law, the parties further agree that in no event shall THE COMPANY’s aggregate liability to Customer exceed $100, nor shall THE COMPANY be liable for special, consequential, incidental, indirect or punitive loss, damage or expenses whether arising in contract or tort (including but not limited to lost profits, loss of data, or the cost of recreating lost data), even if it has been advised of their possible existence. These limitations of liability will apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.</p>
            <h2>16. Dispute Resolution.</h2>
            <p>The parties agree to work together in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding this Agreement internally and by escalating it to higher levels of management and optional mediation, prior to resorting to binding arbitration. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, that cannot be resolved by good faith negotiations shall be finally settled by binding arbitration conducted in the English language in Pennsylvania (USA), under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with the arbitration in such amount as may be determined by the arbitrator. The award of the arbitrator shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties and shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, each party shall have the right to institute judicial proceedings against the other party or anyone acting by, through or under such other party, in order to enforce the instituting party’s rights hereunder through specific performance, injunction or similar equitable relief. This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed, and governed by the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.</p>
            <h2>17. Miscellaneous.</h2>
            <p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations (except for payment obligations hereunder) due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the party affected, including but not limited to war, sabotage, insurrection, riot or other act of civil disobedience, strikes or other labor shortages, act of any government affecting the terms hereof, acts of terrorism, accident, fire, explosion, flood, hurricane, severe weather or other act of God, failure of telecommunication or internet service providers.</p>
            <p>This Agreement and the Privacy Policy constitutes the entire understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written and oral communications, understandings or agreements with respect to its subject matter. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or of any rights or obligations of any party hereunder, will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party waiving compliance. The failure by any party to exercise any right provided herein shall not be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of any such right. Headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed a part of this Agreement.</p>
            <p>Customer shall have no right to assign this Agreement or any of Customer’s rights or obligations hereunder. The Company may assign this Agreement and any of its rights hereunder to third parties. Every provision of this Agreement is intended to be severable. If any section of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then such section will be deemed amended and interpreted, if possible, in a way that renders it enforceable. If such an interpretation is not possible, then the section will be deemed removed from this Agreement and the rest of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <h2>18. Amendment.</h2>
            <p>The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or change this Agreement at any time by posting the changes to its website or through electronic notice to Customer. Customer’s continued use of the Product following the posting or notice of such changes constitutes acceptance of those changes. The Company will use reasonable commercial efforts to provide notice of material changes to Customer.</p>
